# Service Notice & Privacy Disclaimer
## 1. Nature of Service (Open Source)

This service is a hosted instance of an open-source project available on GitHub under the MIT License. It is a free-to-use, personal project operated for testing and research purposes. The service is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.

## 2. Data Privacy & Anonymization

We prioritize user privacy and adhere to a strict "No Raw IP" policy.

How we track: We do NOT store raw IP addresses. Instead, user IP addresses are combined with a random secret key (Pepper) and hashed cryptographically to generate a unique Visitor ID.

Security: This hashing process is one-way and irreversible. The secret key is stored securely within the Cloudflare environment variables, never in the database.

Purpose: This method allows us to distinguish between new and returning visitors without compromising the actual identity or location of the user.

## 3. Infrastructure & Security

All data is stored and processed via Cloudflare D1 (Serverless Database) and Cloudflare Workers. We leverage Cloudflare's global network security to protect data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

## 4. Account & Email Privacy
### 1. Collection & Purpose

We collect your email address solely for account authentication (login) and essential service notifications (e.g., critical updates or security alerts). We collect the minimum amount of information necessary to maintain your account.

### 2. No Spam, No Sharing

Zero Spam Policy: We will never send you marketing emails, newsletters, or advertisements.

No Third-Party Sharing: Your email address is strictly confidential. It will never be sold, shared, or disclosed to third parties or advertisers under any circumstances.

### 3. Data Storage & Deletion

Storage: Your account information is securely stored in our Cloudflare D1 database.

Account Deletion: Currently, account deletion is processed manually. To delete your account, please contact us at aseli4488@gmail.com. Your account and all associated data will be permanently removed within 30 days of your request.
